        Functions in JavaScript:
        Read and comprehend the introductory part on "Functions" at JavaScript.info - Function Basics. Understand why functions are indispensable in scripts.
        Familiarize yourself with the "Function Declaration". Recognize the various components of a function, which includes the function keyword, the function's name, its parameters, and the function body.
        Grasp the general syntax:
        javascriptCopy code
        function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
          // body
        }
        Start practicing by declaring your own functions. Begin with simpler functions without parameters, like the showMessage() example, and then transition to more complex functions with parameters.
        Exercises & Committing to GitHub:
        Create a new JavaScript file to practice the concepts you've picked up.
        Write a minimum of three distinct functions:
        A no-parameter function displaying a greeting.
        A function accepting a name as its parameter to show a personalized greeting.
        A function taking two numbers as parameters, returning their sum.
        Execute your functions to ascertain they operate as anticipated.
        After you've wrapped up your exercises, commit the JavaScript file to a GitHub repository. This not only helps in tracking your progress but also offers a platform to share your code when necessary.
        Post-Learning Reflection:
        Ponder over what you've gleaned. Contemplate on aspects that were challenging and those that were intuitive.
        Note down pivotal takeaways, or consider sharing them with a fellow learner or mentor. Conversing about your comprehension often reinforces the concepts.
