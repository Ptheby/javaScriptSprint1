# javaScriptSprint1
Still learning how to use GitHub.I started Sprint 1. I was uploading some stuff each into it's own repo. I am going to see from 9/1/23 about halfway or more through sprint 1 if this will work uploading evey thing to this repo and organizing it by folders and files, so that I don't have 100's of repos. Not sure what protocol is/
